This is an Android hello world repo,

1. install a version, I recommend the latest version **avalible**
2. Download it
3. Enable "Install unknown apps"
4. Install it
5. Open it

if you are a developer, this might surprise you, if not, you can share it to developers making other apps, and they'll be surprised
